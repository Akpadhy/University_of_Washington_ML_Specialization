# University_of_Washington_ML_Specialization
This repository contains the programming assignment solutions of the Machine Learning Specialization by University of Washington on Coursera. Though the class teaches on Graphlab, I've solved the assignment using Pandas wherever possible.

There are 6 courses in the specialization and I am pursuing the first two. Course #1 is pretty straight forward introduction so I've skipped that one and started with the course on Regression. The first 5 weeks of the course have been updated.

The courses on Classification and Clustering began in Fab'16 and I will keep posting the solutions after the submission deadline passes.
